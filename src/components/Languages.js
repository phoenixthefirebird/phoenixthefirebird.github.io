                            <p className="vert">Java is the first language I became proficient at. I picked up Java first term of second year in my Software Engineering principle
                            course and tackled increasingly challenging tasks and projects. Java's strong type also taught me about object-oriented design principles. This is also
                            the first language where I was introduced concurrency.</p>

                            <p className="vert">Python is one of the first programming language I was taught. Notably my dad had procured a basic Python programming book when I was 14 which I forgot 
                                mostly about due to lack of use. Now I use it with my design team Unmanned Aircraft System using Django framework and also in my applied machine learning
                                class where we use PyTorch.

                            <p className="vert">Ah C++! I'm currently using it in my introduction to algorithm and data structure course. It is definitely the hardest language for me to get used to 
                                but I love the efficiency and control. Plus they are great for honing your algorithm and debugging skills.

                            <p className="vert">Funny thing is C is what my first year programming class was taught in but it wasn't until this term where I get the hang of C through learning C++ and 
                                the very involved labs at my Basics of Computer Systems course. I will never forget writing a debugger for assembly in C.

                            <p className="vert">The first (actually the first this time!) programming language I ever learned, but haven't gotten very good at it until
                            this term when I learned about ES6+ and React.

                            I'm not bad at these low level languages. I just love the software side of computer engineering way more.
