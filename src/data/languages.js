    overlayDesc: `Python is one of the first programming language I was taught.
    Notably my dad had procured a basic Python programming book when
    I was 14 which I forgot mostly about due to lack of use. Now I
    use it with my design team Unmanned Aircraft System using Django
    framework and also in my applied machine learning class where we
    use PyTorch.`,

    overlayDesc: `Ah C++! I'm currently using it in my introduction to algorithm
    and data structure course. It is definitely the hardest language
    for me to get used to but I love the efficiency and control.
    Plus they are great for honing your algorithm and debugging
    skills. (Thanks seg faults)`,

    overlayColor: "overlay lime lighten-5",
    overlayDesc: `Funny thing is C is what my first year programming class was
    taught in but it wasn't until this term where I get the hang of
    C through learning C++ and the very involved labs at my Basics
    of Computer Systems course. I will never forget writing a
    debugger for assembly in C.`,

    ever learned, but haven't gotten very good at it until this term

    overlayDesc: `I don't consider this to be a programming language but I do like
    a good webpage (like this one:p). I learned this along with
    JavaScript. I do do lots of XML in React tho.`,

    overlayColor: "overlay pink lighten-5",
    overlayDesc: `Java is the first language I became proficient at. I picked up
    Java first term of second year in my Software Engineering
    principle course and tackled increasingly challenging tasks and
    projects. Java's strong type also taught me about
    object-oriented design principles. This is also the first
    language where I was introduced concurrency.`,

    overlayColor: "overlay2 red lighten-4",
    overlayDesc: `Yes x86 logo looks cool but I chose this not only because I
    learned x86, but also because ARM and Verilog do not have pretty
    logos! I'm not bad at these low level languages. I just love the
    software side of computer engineering way more.`,
